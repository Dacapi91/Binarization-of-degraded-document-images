# Binarization-of-degraded-document-images

This repository is the implementation of an algorithm that binarizes degraded document images proposed by Di Lu. The method is implemented in MATLAB and is intented to be used to advance reasearch in the scientific community. This method was programmed according to the reference information.

## Files description:

DiLu.m
  -The function to be called that executes the main binarization algorithm
TestDilu.m
  -An example script to execute the DiLu.m function with an example image
